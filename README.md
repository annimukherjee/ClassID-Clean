# ClassID Clean


This repository contains a clean implementation of the ClassID paper.

I first try to get `ClassID/legacy_code/trackling_pipeline_singlethread.py` to run locally on my MBP 32GB RAM machine. Then I will also try to get `ClassID/legacy_code/reid_added_pipeline_singlethread.py` to run on my machine locally.
